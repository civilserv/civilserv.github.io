        <h2>Cabinet of the philippines</h2>


        <p>(<strong>Filipino:</strong> Gabinete ng Pilipinas, usually referred to as the Cabinet or Filipino: Gabinete) consists of the heads of the largest part of the executive branch of the national government of the Philippines. Currently, it includes the secretaries of 21 executive departments and the heads of other several other minor agencies and offices that are subordinate to the President of the Philippines. The Cabinet secretaries are tasked to advise the President on the different affairs of the state like agriculture, budget, finance, education, social welfare, national defence, foreign policy, and the like. They are nominated by the President and then presented to the Commission on Appointments, a body of the Congress of the Philippines that confirms all appointments made by the head of state, for confirmation or rejection. If the presidential appointees are approved, they are sworn into office, receive the title "Secretary", and begin to function their duties.</p>

        <h2>Constitutional and legal basis</h2>


        <p><strong>Article 7, Section 16 of the Constitution of the Philippines says that the President</strong></p>
      
        <p>"shall nominate and, with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, appoint the heads of the executive departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in him in this Constitution. He shall also appoint all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint. The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of other officers lower in rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards."</p>
