        <h2>Length problems</h2>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> Cut a 10-foot (ft.) long piece of wood into two pieces so that one piece is 2 ft. longer than the other. To solve this problem you have two choices:</p> <p><strong>By using algebra:</strong> Call one piece x, then the other piece is x + 2.</p>
        <p>Write an equation: x+x+2=10</p>
        <p>Solve the equation: 2x=8 </p>
            <p>x=4</p>
            <p>x +2=6</p> 
            <p>Total = 10</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Or by using arithmetic:</strong> </p> 
            <p>10 - 2 = 8 Take away the 2 ft. from the whole piece.</p>
            <p>8 + 2 = 4 Divide the piece by 2.</p>
                <p>4 + 2 = 6 Add the 2 ft. to one of the pieces.</p>
                <p>Total = 10</p> 
                <p>The pieces were 4 ft. and 6 ft.</p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> A length of board was 10 inches shorter than another length. Together the boards were 20 inches. How long were the boards</p> 
        <p><strong>Call the long piece x and the short piece x - 10.</strong></p>
        <p>x+x-10=20</p>
        <p>2x = 30</p>
        <p>x = 15</p>
        <p>15 - 10 = 5</p>
        <p>The pieces were 5 and 15 in.</p>

    <h2>Age problems</h2>


    <p><strong>1.</strong>Leah is 2 years older than Tracy. Together the girls are 10 years old. How old are they</p>
        <p><strong>Call Leah's age x. Then Tracy's age is x - 2.</strong></p>
        <p>x+x-2 = 10</p>
        <p>2x = 12</p>
        <p>x=6</p>
        <p>x - 2 = 4</p>
        <p>Leah is 6 years old and Tracy is 4.</p>

        <h2>Inequalities Using the Words</h2>
        <h2>"At Least" and "At Most"</h2>

    <p><strong>The symbols below translate into words the following way:</strong></p>
      <p>< is less than.</p>
      <p>&le; is less than or equal to.</p>
      <p>> is greater than.</p>
      <p>&ge; is equal to or greater than.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>In word problems these symbols can also be used to translate:</strong></p>
      <p>&le; at most</p>
      <p>&ge; at least</p>

      <p><strong>Example: translate and solve</strong></p>
      <p>1/3 of an unknown number is less than 4.</p>
      <p>x/3 < 4</p>
      <p>Multiply both sides by 3: x < 12</p>
      <p>The unknown number can be any number smaller than 12.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>10-x &le; 22</p>
      <p>Subtract 10: -x &le; 12</p>
      <p>Multiply by -1: x &ge; -12</p>
      <p>Note: When we multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the inequality sign!</p>
      <p>x can be any number that is equal to or greater than -12.</p>

        <h2>Number Problems</h2>
        <p>Number problems deal with numbers, usually integers (whole numbers, which includes zero, and their negatives). An 
            equation can be written once the problem has been stated. If 
            the problem states something special about a number, that 
            number is usually calledx. Often these numbers deal with consecutive integers, which are integers that follow in order such 
            as 5, 6, 7,. . . or 4, -3, -2 ,... Consecutive odd or even integers 
            are two numbers apart, such as 2, 4, 6 ,... or 1, 3, 5 ,... If you 
            add 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, we have an odd sum of odd numbers, but 
            1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. A sum of four odd integers gives an even 
            sum. Can a sum of even consecutive integers ever be odd?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>The sum of three consecutive integers is 6. Find the integers.</p>
            <p><strong>Call the and x + 2 smallest integer x. Then the others are x + 1</strong></p>
            <p>The sum is x+x+ 1 +x+ 2 or 6.</p>
            <p>3x + 3 = 6</p>
            <p>3x = 3</p>
            <p>x = 1</p>
            <p>x + 1 = 2 </p>
            <p>x + 2 = 3</p>
            <p>The consecutive integers are 1,2, and 3.</p>
            <p><strong>Check:</strong> 1 + 2 + 3 = 6</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>The sum of four consecutive even integers is 44. Find the integers.</p>
            <p><strong>Call the integers x, x + 2, x + 4, x + 6.</strong></p>
            <p>The sum is x + x + 2 + x + 4 + x + 6 or 44.</p>
            <p>4x + 12 = 44</p>
            <p> 4x = 32</p>
            <p> x = 8</p>
            <p> x + 2 = 10</p>
            <p> x + 4 = 12<</p>
            <p> x + 6 = 14<</p>
            <p>The four integers are 8, 10,12, and 14.</p>
            <p>Check: 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 44</p>

            <h2>Percents and Decimal</h2>

        <p>The word percent consists of two parts: per and cent. Per 
            means "divide by" and cent means "hundred." </p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>a)100% = 100 &#247; 100 = 1 (that is, "the whole thing")  </p>
            <p>b) 50%=50&#247;100</p>
            <p>50/100= 1/2 or 0.5</p>
            <p>c)1/2%=1/2 &#247;100= 1/2 x 1/100 </p>
            <p>1/200 or 0.005</p> 
            <p>0.25% = 0.0025</p>

            <h2>Percent and Numbers</h2>
            
            <p><strong>These problems come in three forms:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1.</strong>What percent of a number is another number?</p> 
            <p><strong>2.</strong> A known % of what number is another number?</p>
            <p><strong>3.</strong>A known % of a known number is what number? </p>   
            <p>Using algebra, we can write three equations where x is the 
                unknown ("what") number and a and b are known numbers:</p> 
            <p>a) x% . a = b (In math problems, multiplication is 
                shown by a dot between the numbers that are to be 
                multiplied.) </p>
            <p>b)a% . x = b</p>
            <p>c) a%  . b = x</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p> What % of 60 is 15? </p>
            <p>x%.60=15 </p>
            <p>x/100.60=15</p>
            <p>x=1500/60</p>
            <p>x=25</p>

            
            </div>

            <div class="box">
    
                <h2>The Percent is included</h2>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>What number increased by 6% is 2544? </p>
                <p>100% + 6% = 106%</p>
                <p>106% of what number is 2544? </p>
                <p>2544/1/06=2400</p>
                <p>Check: 6% of 2400 = 144 and 2400 + 144 = 2544</p>

                <div class="box">
    
                <p>Percent increase and decrease</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p>In many problems we have information "before and after." For 
                    example, the price of eggs was $1.29 for a dozen eggs last month 
                    and now it is $1.49. What was the percent increase? 
                    Percents 33 
                    The original price of the eggs was $1.29 and the increase 
                    was $1.49 - $1.29 = $0.20. The problem can then be 
                    restated: What % of 1.29 is 0.20? </p>
                <p><strong>Equation:</strong></p>
                <p> x% . 1.29 = 0.20 </p>
                <p>x = 15.5 (rounded)</p>
                <p>The price increased by 15.5%</p>

                    <h2>Discounts</h2>
                    <p><strong>Stores often advertise a reduction of their prices with words

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <p>The price of a dress was reduced from $200 to $180. What was

                        <p>The discount was $20 and the original price $200. The 
                            problem can be rewritten as "What percent of 200 is 
                            20?"</p>
                        <p>x% x 200 = 20 </p>
