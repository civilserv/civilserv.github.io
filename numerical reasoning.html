        <h2>Using Whole Numbers</h2>

        
       <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> In a conference center, the Mountain View Room can seat 78
        people, the Lake View Room can seat 32 people, and the Trail View Room
        can seat 46 people. Find the total number of people that can be seated at any
        one time.</p>
       <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> You are being asked to find the total number of people that can be seated</p>
       <p><strong>STRATEGY</strong> Use addition since you need to find a total and all the items in the problem are the same (i.e., people)</p>
       <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong> 78 + 32 + 46 = 156</p>
       <p><strong>EVALUATION</strong>The conference center can seat 156 people. This can be checked by estimation. Round each value and then find the sum:
        80 þ 30 + 45 ¼ 155. Since the estimated sum is close to the actual sum, you
        can conclude that the answer is probably correct. (Note: When using estimation, you cannot be 100% sure your answer is correct since you have used
        rounded numbers.</p>
       <p>use <strong>SUBTRACTION</strong> when you are asked to find </p>

        <h2></h2>

        
        <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> If Lake Erie is 241 miles long and Lake Huron is 206 miles long, how much longer is Lake Erie than Lake Huron?</p>
           <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> You are being asked to find how much longer Lake Erie is than Lake Huron</p>
           <p><strong>STRATEGY:</strong> Since you are being asked ‘‘how much longer’’ and both items are the same (miles), you use subtraction.</p>
           <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION:</strong> 241 miles - 206 miles ¼ 35 miles. Hence, Lake Erie is 35 miles longer than Lake Huron</p>
           <p><strong>EVALUATION:</strong> You can check the solution by adding: 206 + 35 ¼ 241</p>
           <p>use <strong>MULTIPLICATION</strong> when you are asked to find </p>

        <h2></h2>

        
        <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> Find the total number of seats in an auditorium if there are 22 rows with 36 seats in a row.</p>
           <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> You are being asked to find the total number of seats in the auditorium.</p>
           <p><strong>STRATEGY:</strong> Use multiplication because you are asked to find a total and you have 22 rows (groups) of seats with 36 (individual items) in a row</p>
           <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION:</strong>: 36 x 22 ¼ 792 seats. Hence, the auditorium has 792 seats</p>
           <p><strong>EVALUATION</strong> You can check your answer by estimation: 40 x 20 ¼ 800. Since 792 is close to 800, your answer is probably correct. Use division when you are given the total number of items and a number of
            groups and need to find how many items in each group or when you are given
            the total number of items and the number of items in each group and need to
            find how many groups</p>

        <h2></h2>

        
        <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> The shipping department of a business needs to ship 496 calculators. If they are packed 8 per box, how many boxes will be needed?</p>
           <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> You are being asked to find how many boxes are needed.</p>
           <p><strong>STRATEGY:</strong> Here you are given the total number of calculators, 496, and need to pack 8 items in each box. You are asked to find how many boxes(groups) are needed. In this case, use division</p>
           <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION:</strong> 496 &#247; 8 ¼ 62 boxes. Hence, you will need 62 boxes</p>
           <p><strong>EVALUATION:</strong>Check: 62 boxes x 8 calculators per box ¼ 496 calculators.
            Now you can see how to decide what operation to use to solve arithmetic
            or preaglebra problems using whole numbers</p>

    <h2>Using Decimals</h2>
        
        <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> If a lawnmower uses 0.6 of a gallon of gasoline per hour, how many gallons of gasoline will be used if it takes 2.6 hours to cut a lawn? </p>
        <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> You are being asked to find the total number of gallons of gasoline used</p>
        <p><strong>STRATEGY:</strong> Since you need to find a total and you are given two different
            items (gallons and hours), you multiply </p>
        <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION:</strong> 0.6 x 2.6 ¼ 1.56 gallons </p>
        <p><strong>EVALUATION:</strong> You can check your answer using estimation. You use
            about one half of a gallon per hour. In two hours you would use about one
            gallon and another half of a gallon for the last half hour, so you would use
            approximately one and one half gallons. This is close to 1.56 gallons since
            one and one half is 1.5</p>

        <h2>Percents</h2>
            
            <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> Write each percent as a decimal</p>
            <p><strong>A)</strong>54%</p>
            <p><strong>B)</strong>6%</p>
            <p><strong>C)</strong>235%</p>
            <p><strong>D)</strong>42.8%</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
            <p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A)</strong> 54%  = 0.54</p>
            <p><strong>B)</strong> 6% = 0.06</p>
            <p><strong>C)</strong>235% = 2.35</p>
            <p><strong>D)</strong> 42.8% = 0.428</p>

<p></p>
<p> </p>
            <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>Change each decimal to a percent</p>
            <p><strong>A)</strong> 0.83</p>
            <p><strong>B)</strong> 0.05</p>
            <p><strong>C)</strong> 4.32</p>
            <p><strong>D)</strong> 0.137</p>
            
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

            <p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A)</strong> 0.83 = 83%</p>
            <p><strong>B)</strong> 0.05 = 5%</p>
            <p><strong>C)</strong> 4.32 = 432%</p>
            <p><strong>D)</strong> 0.137 ¼ 13.7%</p>
