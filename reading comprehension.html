        <h2> The invention of the compact disc, and explains how it works</h2>

       <p><strong>I.</strong> Compact discs (CDs), which may be found in over 25 million American homes, not to mention backpacks and automobiles, first entered popular culture in the 1980s. But their history goes back to the 1960s, when an inventor named James Russell decided to create an alternative to his scratched and warped phonograph records—a system that could record, store, and replay music without ever wearing out.</p>
       <p><strong>II.</strong> The result was the compact disc (CD). Made from 1.2 mm of polycarbonate plastic, the disc is coated with a much thinner aluminum layer that is then protected with a film of lacquer. The lacquer layer can be printed with a label. CDs are typically 120 mm in diameter, and can store about 74 minutes of music. </p>
       <p><strong>III.</strong> There are also discs that can store 80, 90, 99, and 100 minutes of music, but they are not as compatible with various stereos and computers as the 74 - minute size.The information on a standard CD is contained on the polycarbonate layer, as a single spiral track of pits, starting at the inside of the disk and circling its way to the outside. This information is read by shining light from a 780 nm wavelength semiconductor laser through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The light from the laser follows the spiral track of pits, and is then reflected off either the pit or the aluminum layer. Because the CD is read through the bottom of the disc, each pit looks like a bump to the laser. </p> 
       <p><strong>IV.</strong> Information is read as the laser moves over the bumps (where no light will be reflected) and the areas that have no bumps, also known as land (where the laser light will be reflected off the aluminum). The changes in reflectivity are interpreted by a part of the compact disc player known as the detector.  </p>
       <p><strong>V.</strong> It is the job of the detector to convert the information collected by the laser into the music that was originally recorded onto the disc. This invention brought 22 patents to James Russell, who today says he working on an even better system for recording and playing back music.</p>

        <h2>Current state of the modeling industry</h2>

        <p><strong>I.</strong> The beginning of the twenty-first century has been called the end of the supermodel era by fashion magazines, trend watchers, and news organizations around the world. The models are being replaced, so the theory goes, with actors. Check the covers of fashion magazines, and you will find that many on any given month feature an actor, rather than a model. But, as with most trends, this is nothing new</p>
        <p><strong>II.</strong> From its beginnings in the 1920s, the modeling industry has provided beautiful people to help sell everything from magazines to computers to vacation destinations. John Robert Powers, who opened the first modeling agency in 1923, was a former actor who hired his actor friends to model for magazine advertisements. Cary Grant, Lucille Ball, and Princess Grace of Monaco were clients. However, for many models simply being “great-looking” was where their resumés began and ended.</p>
        <p><strong>III.</strong> The height of popularity for them was in the 1980s and 1990s, the era of the supermodel. A handful of “perfect” women commanded salaries of up to $25,000 a day to walk catwalks at fashion shows, appear in print ads, and pose their way through commercials. They were celebrities, treated with all of the lavish attention usually paid to heads of state or rock stars.But that was in the supermodel heyday. As designers and magazine editors began to favor more exotic and more “real” looking models, the modeling handful grew into an army.</p>
        <p><strong>IV.</strong> The demand for the perfect looking select few dropped, and women who had quirky smiles, a few extra pounds, spiky hair, or were past their twenties, gained favor. This group was joined by those who achieved success in some other venue, such as music (think Renee Fleming raving about a watch), sports (Tiger Woods happily devouring his Wheaties®), and acting (Danny Glover waxing rhapsodic over MCI).</p>
        <p><strong>V.</strong> Iconic fashion designer Calvin Klein summed it up: “I don't think that people are that interested in models anymore. It's not a great moment for the modeling industry. It says a lot about our society and I think it's good.”</p>

        <h2>Computer Museum of America, and details an important item in its collection</h2>

        <p><strong>I.</strong> Wondering what to do with that old Atari Home Video Game in the attic? It's on the wish list of the Computer Museum of America, in San Diego, California, which hopes you will donate it to their holdings. The Museum was founded in 1983 to amass and preserve historic computer equipment such as calculators, card punches, and typewriters, and now owns one of the world's largest collections. In addition, it has archives of computer-related magazines, manuals, and books that are available to students, authors, researchers, and others for historical research.</p>
        <p><strong>II.</strong> One item currently on display is a 1920s comptometer, advertised as “The Machine Gun of the Office.” The comptometer was first sneered at by accountants and bookkeepers, many of whom could add four columns of numbers in their heads. The new machine was the first that could do the work faster than humans. The comptometer gained a large following, and its operation became a formal profession that required serious training. But by the 1970s, computers took over, and comptometers, and the job of operating them, became obsolete.</p>

        <h2> The origins and development of the modern shopping mall</h2>

        <p><strong>I.</strong> Today's shopping mall has as its antecedents historical marketplaces, such as Greek agoras, European piazzas, and Asian bazaars. The purpose of these sites, as with the shopping mall, is both economic and social. People go not only to buy and sell wares, but also to be seen, catch up on news, and be part of the human drama. Both the marketplace and its descendant the mall might also contain restaurants, banks, theaters, and professional offices.</p>
        <p><strong>II.</strong> illages outside of cities have existed since antiquity, it was the tech￾nological and transportation advances of the 19th century that gave rise to a conscious exodus of the population away from crowded, industrialized cities toward quieter, more rural towns. Since the sub￾urbs typically have no centralized marketplace, shopping centers or malls were designed to fill the needs of the changing community, providing retail stores and services to an increasing suburban population.</p>
        <p><strong>III.</strong> The shopping mall differs from its ancient counterparts in a number of important ways. While piazzas and bazaars were open-air venues, the modern mall is usually enclosed. Since the suburbs are spread out geographically, shoppers drive to the mall, which means that parking areas must be an integral part of a mall's design. Ancient marketplaces were often set up in public spaces, but shopping malls are designed, built, and maintained by a separate management firm as a unit. The first shopping mall was built by J. C. Nichols in 1922 near Kansas City, Missouri. The Country Club Plaza was designed to be an automobile-centered plaza, as its patrons drove their own cars to it, rather than take mass transportation as was often the case for city shoppers.</p>
        <p><strong>IV.</strong> It was constructed according to a unified plan, rather than as a random group of stores. Nichols’ company owned and operated the mall, leasing space to a variety of tenants. The first enclosed mall was the Galleria Vittoria Emanuele in Milan, Italy in 1865-77. Inspired by its design, Victor Gruen took the shopping and dining experience of the Galleria to a new level when he created the Southdale Center Mall in 1956. Located in a suburb of Minneapolis, it was intended to be a substitute for the traditional city center. The 95- acre, two-level structure had a constant climate-controlled temperature of 72 degrees, and included shops, restaurants, a school, a post office, and a skating rink. Works of art, decorative lighting, fountains, tropical plants, and flowers were placed throughout the mall.</p>
        <p><strong>V.</strong> Southdale afforded people the opportunity to experience the pleasures of urban life while protected from the harsh Minnesota weather. In the 1980s, giant megamalls were developed. While Canada has had the distinction of being home to the largest of the megamalls for over twenty years, that honor will soon go to Dubai, where the Mall of Arabia is being completed at a cost of over five billion U.S. dollars. The 5.3 million square foot West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, opened in 1981, with over 800 stores, 110 eating establishments, a hotel, an amusement park, a miniature-golf course, a church, a zoo, and a 438-foot-long lake.</p>
